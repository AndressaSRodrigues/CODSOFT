# CODSOFT

This repository encompasses two distinct projects: a dynamic job board and an engaging quiz maker website. Both initiatives were conceived and implemented during my internship at CODSOFT. Here's a brief overview:

**[HireHub](https://hirehub.vercel.app/)**: A Job Search Platform
HireHub provides a great job search experience, seamlessly connecting talented individuals with exceptional opportunities. The platform boasts a robust backend powered by Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, ensuring efficient data handling and storage. On the frontend, a modern and responsive interface is crafted using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.
