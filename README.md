# CODSOFT

This repository encompasses two distinct projects: a dynamic job board and an engaging quiz maker website. Both initiatives were conceived and implemented during my internship at CODSOFT. Here's a brief overview:

**[HireHub](https://hirehub.vercel.app/)**: A Job Search Platform

HireHub provides a great job search experience, seamlessly connecting talented individuals with exceptional opportunities. The platform boasts a robust backend powered by Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, ensuring efficient data handling and storage. On the frontend, a modern and responsive interface is crafted using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

QuizHub is a dynamic website where users can explore the quizzes created by the community and create their own quizzes. It's a user-friendly website with an intuitive interface built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. Its backend was built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.
